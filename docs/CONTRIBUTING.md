# Contributing Guide

We'd love your help!

The OpenTelemetry .NET Instrumentation special interest group (SIG) meets regularly.
See the OpenTelemetry [community](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#net-auto-instrumentation)
repo for information on this and other SIGs.

See the [public meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XedN2D8_PH4YLej-maT8sp4RKogfuhFpccRi3QpUcoI/edit)
for a summary description of past meetings.
Join the meeting or get in touch on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-auto-instr).

[contribution guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and the

Comment on the issue that you want to work on so we can assign it to you and
clarify anything related to it.

If you would like to work on something that is not listed as an issue
(e.g. a new feature or enhancement) please first read our [vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F25EzxYa7iSs2r9u0kjetCNPGS7Ui-bneHJEEwzEFR4/edit#heading=h.lp5s13snr6b)
and
[roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F25EzxYa7iSs2r9u0kjetCNPGS7Ui-bneHJEEwzEFR4/edit#heading=h.kukvo6w51274)
to make sure your proposal aligns with the goals of the
project, then create an issue and describe your proposal. It is best to do this
in advance so that maintainers can decide if the proposal is a good fit for
this repository. This will help avoid situations when you spend significant time
on something that maintainers may decide this repo is not the right place for.
