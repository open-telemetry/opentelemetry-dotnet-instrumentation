## Report a bug

Reporting bugs is an important contribution. Please make sure to include:

* OpenTelemetry, OS, and .NET versions you are using
* If possible, steps to reproduce

## Request a feature

If you would like to work on something that is not listed as an issue
(e.g. a new feature or enhancement) please first read our [design.md](design.md)
to make sure your proposal aligns with the goals of the
project, then create an issue and describe your proposal.

## How to contribute

Please read the [OpenTelemetry New Contributor Guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/tree/main/guides/contributor)
and the [code of conduct](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Comment on the issue that you want to work on so we can assign it to you and
clarify anything related to it.

If you would like to work on something that is not listed as an issue,
please [request a feature](#request-a-feature) first.
It is best to do this in advance so that maintainers can decide if the proposal
is a good fit for this repository.
This will help avoid situations when you spend significant time
on something that maintainers may decide this repo is not the right place for.

the development environment setup and usage.
