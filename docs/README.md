# OpenTelemetry .NET Auto-Instrumentation

[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-@cncf/otel--dotnet--auto--instr-brightgreen.svg?logo=slack)](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01NR1YLSE7)

This project provides a .NET tracer that leverages the .NET profiling APIs to support .NET instrumentation and auto-instrumentation without requiring code changes to an application.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for installation, usage and configuration instructions.

## Status

This project is in the early stages of development starting with an initial seeding of code from the [.NET Tracer for Datadog APM](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet). Our current goal is to take the seeded tracer and update it to both listen to and generate OpenTelemetry tracing data.

For more details about the design and roadmap see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

# Development

## Windows

### Minimum requirements
- [Visual Studio 2019 (16.8)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or newer
  - Workloads
    - Desktop development with C++
    - .NET desktop development
    - .NET Core cross-platform development
    - Optional: ASP.NET and web development (to build samples)
  - Individual components
    - .NET Framework 4.7 targeting pack
- [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- [.NET 5.0 x86 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) to run 32-bit tests locally
- Optional: [ASP.NET Core 2.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) to test in .NET Core 2.1 locally.
- Optional: [ASP.NET Core 3.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) to test in .NET Core 3.0 locally.
- Optional: [ASP.NET Core 3.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) to test in .NET Core 3.1 locally.
- Optional: [nuget.exe CLI](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) v5.3 or newer
- Optional: [WiX Toolset 3.11.1](http://wixtoolset.org/releases/) or newer to build Windows installer (msi)
  - [WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extension](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/) to build installer from Visual Studio
- Optional: [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) to build Linux binaries and run integration tests on Linux containers. See [section on Docker Compose](#building-and-running-tests-with-docker-compose).
  - Requires Windows 10 (1607 Anniversary Update, Build 14393 or newer)


This repository uses [Nuke](https://nuke.build/) for build automation. To see a list of possible targets run:

```cmd
.\build.cmd --help
```

For example:

```powershell
# Clean and build the main tracer project
.\build.cmd Clean BuildTracerHome

# Build and run managed and native unit tests. Requires BuildTracerHome to have previously been run
.\build.cmd BuildAndRunManagedUnitTests BuildAndRunNativeUnitTests 

# Build NuGet packages and MSIs. Requires BuildTracerHome to have previously been run
.\build.cmd PackageTracerHome 

# Build and run integration tests. Requires BuildTracerHome to have previously been run
.\build.cmd BuildAndRunWindowsIntegrationTests
```

## Linux

The recommended approach for Linux is to build using Docker. You can use this approach for both Windows and Linux hosts. The _build_in_docker.sh_ script automates building a Docker image with the required dependencies, and running the specified Nuke targets. For example:

```bash
# Clean and build the main tracer project
./build_in_docker.sh Clean BuildTracerHome

# Build and run managed unit tests. Requires BuildTracerHome to have previously been run
./build_in_docker.sh BuildAndRunManagedUnitTests 

# Build and run integration tests. Requires BuildTracerHome to have previously been run
./build_in_docker.sh BuildAndRunLinuxIntegrationTests
```
