# Design

## Vision

> High-level goals defining the long term vision for the project that will guide daily activities, its design, and feature acceptance.

- **High performance**: auto-instrumentation performance impact should not be a concern for its users.
- **Reliability**: stable and performant under different loads. Well-behaved under extreme load, with predictable, low resource consumption.
- **Visibility**: users should be able to generate telemetry data that provides deep and detailed visibility into their applications. Such telemetry must allow users to identify and solve application-related issues in production.
- **Useful out-of-the-box**: after install users should be able to get telemetry data from targeted libraries with none or minimal configuration (good selection of defaults).
- **Extensible**: key components can be chosen via configuration and plugins.

## Constraints

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"  are to be interpreted as described in 
[BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14), [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)], [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)]
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

- MUST NOT reference external libraries to prevent instrumented applications from breaking or behaving unexpectedly.
- Compliance to [Common Language Specification (CLS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components)
is OPTIONAL. More: [#131](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/issues/131).

## Plans

[Preliminary Roadmap Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F25EzxYa7iSs2r9u0kjetCNPGS7Ui-bneHJEEwzEFR4/edit#heading=h.8ps4qge8rkv6)

### Linkage with spans created via [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet)

Currnelty, in short term, the spans can properly linked with ones created using [OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp).

In future, it is planned to properly link the spans created using [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet).

Tracked under [#13](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/issues/13).

### Reuse of [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet)

Currently, in short term, we are reimplementing Open Telemetry components like Exporters, Propagators which are already implemented in [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet). This is mainly because the current tracing model is different than in [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet).

In future, it is planned to redesign the model so that we could reuse code implemented in [OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet).
