This program is a simple application that gets/sets values in a postgres database. To reproduce the actual TypeLoadException, the `tools/SynchronizeVersions` tool needs to be run to set the version of the live build to a version earlier than the version of the `Datadog.Trace.ClrProfiler.Managed` NuGet package specified in the .csproj file. When this program is run on .NET Core, .NET Core will load the newer version from the NuGet package instead of loading the correct version that lives alongside the profiler in the file system. Before making the proper version checks in the profiler, the ADO.NET methods will be instrumented and there will be entries in the profiler logs saying that method calls were replaced. After making the proper version checks in the profiler, we will enforce a strict version-match requirement and there will be no method replacements.
